    <h3>Veronica</h3>
        <p> It is a horror movie and it looks real and kinda scary too.
        </p>

    <h3>Hunted Changi</h3>
        <p> It is also a horror movie, it is like a documentary movie where they filmed the whole 
            hospital and the crew stayed there for a long period of time and didn't make out alive. 
            It's kinda scarry too
